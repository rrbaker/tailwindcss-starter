# tailwindcss-starter

 Starter files for a new Tailwind CSS project, based on (their tutorial screencasts)[https://tailwindcss.com/course/setting-up-tailwind-and-postcss]. This also includes the last step in their tutorial: support for PurgeCSS as well when building for production.

 ### Steps
 
 1. Download repo
 1. Run `npm install`
 1. Run `npm run build`

 That's it. Probably use npm's live-server or Valet to load it up in the browser (from the build directory) and make sure it's working.
